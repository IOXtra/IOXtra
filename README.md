☕ About IOXtra

We’re IOXtra — a small studio building things we love:

from AI-powered workflows to edge-native software.



🎧 Who We Are



A sound engineer and composer,

Natural with:

🎶 Music composition & production

🎬 Foley, dubbing & post-production

🧠 AI for sound restoration & noise cleanup

🧩 Plugin development for Ableton & creative audio tools



His mix of art, science, and engineering brings ideas to life — from perfectly mixed tracks to smart, to AI-assisted studio workflows.



💻 And a developer,

28+ years of experience building system and web architecture, onsite and cloud systems, and edge deployment tech — now distilled into one goal:



      “To help people create offline and publish anywhere.”



without being tied to PaaS or SaaS systems.



Currently developing WEAStack and WEASuite — a cross-platform, offline-first environment for writing, research, and publishing.



Together, we blend code, creativity, and sound — using AI and edge technology to empower creators, students, and professionals alike.



🌱 Why We’re Here



We use Buy Me a Coffee to fund:

- Plugin and AI research in sound editing & design

- Continued development of our software

- And to keep our work independent, ad-free, and community-driven



Every coffee helps us push these projects forward — one line of code, one plugin, one sound at a time.



🦦 Our Current Projects

WEASuite / WEAStack — Create → Build → Publish — the offline-first publishing stack

AI Audio Tools — sound cleanup & plugin engineering for music producers

Edge-Native Architecture — Cloudflare-powered, zero-server deployment stack



❤️ Thank You

Whether you’re supporting for the love of music, code, or independent creation —
